	    <h1>About Korea Pet Project</h1>
   		<p>I was searching for an up to date directory of Korea's animal shelters (in English), and I couldn't find anything. So I decided to start this project and leave it open to the community.</p>
		
		<p>There are a lot of dogs and cats in Korea that need good homes. I am hoping that this project can help provide useful information to those interested in adopting a pet.</p>
