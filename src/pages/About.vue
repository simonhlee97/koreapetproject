	    <h1>About Korea Pet Project</h1>
   		<p>I was searching for an up to date directory of Korea's animal shelters (in English), and I couldn't find anything. So I decided to start this project and leave it open to the community.</p>
		
		<p>There are a lot of dogs and cats in Korea that need good homes. I am hoping that this project can help provide useful information to those interested in adopting a pet.</p>

		<p>If you are a developer and want to make this site look prettier, feel free to <a href='https://github.com/simonhlee97/' target='_blank'>visit the repo</a> and look at the code.</p>
		<p>Thanks for visiting.</p>
